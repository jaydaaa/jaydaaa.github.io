        <h1>Usability Subheading</h1>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>I studied my web portfolio and my target audience was students in game and web design. The three tasks I gave them were to use the navigation tabs to go to my javascript page, then fill out the form, and lastly to go the video web page and sue the buttons to watch the video.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Yes, they were ble to complete the subjects I assigned them. It was easy for them to understand the procedures because they were simple and didn't take too much time.</p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>I learned I can get useful feedback when I have a target audience view my work. It helps me understand what information I need to work on and modify in my html. THe website works well but it would be beneficial to work on my css.</p>
